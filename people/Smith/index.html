His timid demeanor clashes with Norris’s swaggering bellicosity, but his encyclopedic knowledge of Rockay’s criminal underworld renders him indispensable, even if most of the Sheriff’s wordplay is wasted on him.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>A Rockay City local, <dfn class="self soft">Smith</dfn> spends his early years as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy Scouts of America">Boy Scout</a> before he enrolls in the police academy. He discovers a knack for intelligence gathering, but his meekness and distaste for politics foreclose much career advancement. After the explosion at King’s skyscraper eliminates the RCPD’s upper echelons, and the governor appoints Norris to lead the gutted department, the new Sheriff promotes <dfn class="self soft">Smith</dfn> to acquaint himself with the local players and take advantage of <dfn class="self soft">Smith</dfn>’s network of informants.</p><p><dfn class="self soft">Smith</dfn> works behind the scenes at the RCPD, regularly briefing Norris on Rockay’s gangs and their operations. While Baker never directly encounters him, his investigations often complicate Baker’s plans. <dfn class="self soft">Smith</dfn> uncovers Khan’s smuggling activity and interferes with Baker’s <a href="/jobs/coc_CokeOrCaviar/">heist</a> aboard the <i>Miss Olga</i>. He also predicts the Money Train robbery, so Norris’s men respond quickly and in full force when the <span class=spoilers title="Click to show spoiler">bomb derails the train</span>. According to an Urban Legend, he even anticipates Baker’s <a href="/missions/HV1_Oceans13/">Hidden Vault heist</a> after his crew <span class=spoilers title="Click to show spoiler"><a href="/missions/FTM_Oceans13/">breaks</a> Mozart out of prison</span>.</p><h2>Outcomes</h2><p>After Baker secures control of the entire city, he <span class=spoilers title="Click to show spoiler">negotiates with the governor to legitimize his authority, and <dfn class="self soft">Smith</dfn> flees the city with Norris</span>. If instead <dfn class="self soft">Smith</dfn> and Norris complete their investigation, they <span class=spoilers title="Click to show spoiler">send the entire RCPD to swarm the Stallion Club and <a href="/missions/raid_HQRaid-GreatEscape/">drive</a> Baker out of town.</span></p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li><dfn class="self soft">Smith</dfn> is a licensed helicopter pilot.</li><li><dfn class="self soft">Smith</dfn> is voiced by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1654861">Kerby Joe Grubb II</a>, who also performs Ropes’s lines.</li></ul></div></article><footer class=bottom><nav><ul><li><a href="/meta/about/">Made with<span class=heart></span>by rtkz</a><li><a href="/meta/settings/">Settings</a></ul></nav></footer><script src=/d.js></script><script src=/a.js></script>
