It’s not just <a href="/people/Hielo/">Hielo</a>’s gang and <a href="/people/Dollar-Dragon/">Dollar Dragon</a>’s. There seems to be a new player in town. Unconfirmed reports say this new boss is one <a href="/people/Travis-Baker/" class=soft>Travis Baker</a>—just rocked up to the rotten apple and decided to take a bite.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Axel-Rod-Pseudonym/>Axel Rod Pseudonym</a>:</span><span class=sub>Rumors suggest that he’s not alone. Details have emerged of his core team of cronies: a <a href="/people/Secretary/">calculating businesswoman</a>, a <a href="/people/Agent/">shady ex-cop</a>, and a <a href="/people/Captain/">disgraced former NFL footballer</a> on his team, as well as an <a href="/people/Hand/">in-the-shadows consigliere</a> pulling the strings behind the scenes—this, and a seemingly endless supply of mercenaries fighting for him.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Axel-Rod-Pseudonym/>Axel Rod Pseudonym</a>:</span><span class=sub>So, where is he getting the cash to fund his private militia? A series of heists and gang wars rocked Rockay City to the core. Obviously a bid for expansion and to fuel this most hostile of takeovers. Reports have even placed <a href="/people/Travis-Baker/" class=soft>Baker</a> at the scene of these crimes, although it has also been reported multiple times that the pretender to the criminal throne has been killed. With every report of his supposed death, it seems that <a href="/people/Travis-Baker/" class=soft>Baker</a> only comes back stronger, displaying new <span>skills</span> and talents with each new criminal campaign.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Axel-Rod-Pseudonym/>Axel Rod Pseudonym</a>:</span><span class=sub>Law enforcement are finding it impossible to predict where he will strike next. Each new campaign seems entirely different from the one he waged before. The name on the street for this overall wave of terror is Baker’s Battle, and the <a href="/families/civilian/">citizens</a> of Rockay are getting caught in the crossfire.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Axel-Rod-Pseudonym/>Axel Rod Pseudonym</a>:</span><span class=sub>Some even say that <a href="/people/Travis-Baker/" class=soft>Baker</a> is occasionally involved in a new kind of criminal campaign that the police are dubbing Crime Time. These seemingly random jobs are similar to the crimes in Baker’s Battle but opportunistic and, it seems, performed just as some quick thrills and entertainment. In these short campaigns, all the resources and mercenaries from Baker’s Battle are used, so it seems the more time <a href="/people/Travis-Baker/" class=soft>Baker</a> is putting into his main campaign, the more thrills members of his gang are getting during Crime Time.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Axel-Rod-Pseudonym/>Axel Rod Pseudonym</a>:</span><span class=sub>Even more disturbing are the Urban Legends. Some of these teammates and mercenaries have been unlocked to work together on a campaign of six short crimes together in up to teams of four. Some of these mercenaries are so intent on their criminal activities that they have been dubbed “bots” by street-level thugs although these gang members and bots bleed, and if they die, they’re out for the rest of the cooperative six-shot campaign. Each of the Urban Legends consists of four unique teammates and two backups. A team of six, six missions—are we just one six away from a biblical reference? Well, it certainly seems these devils are one step away from turning Rockay City into a living, neon-soaked Hell.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Axel-Rod-Pseudonym/>Axel Rod Pseudonym</a>:</span><span class=sub>We now turn over to <a href="/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/" class=soft>Fran Ann McGann</a> with a scathing exposé on the latest sounds and—tunes? from Rockay City? Are you kidding me with this crap? No! Eh—I’m not—I can’t deal with this kind of lack of absolute professionalism any more. I’m trying to do serious journalism here. I’m—I’m out of here!</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Jingle</a>:</span><span class=sub><i><a href="/culture/K-RCT-Rockay-City-Talk-Radio/" class=soft>K-RCT Rockay City Talk Radio</a></i>.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>Thank you for that questionable introduction, <a href="/people/Axel-Rod-Pseudonym/" class=soft>Axel</a>.
