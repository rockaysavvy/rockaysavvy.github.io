An <a href="/culture/Under-Water-Life/" class=soft>under water world</a> will take you to the dark depths of an ocean you’ve never seen and you will have no idea what lurks behind each crag, crevice, and strand of seaweed. Only in cinemas this summer.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>Bickley St. James reporting for <a href="/culture/K-RCT-Rockay-City-Talk-Radio/" class=soft>K-RCT Rockay City Talk Radio</a>, South Florida’s #1 station for talk, news, and traffic. Today we’re speaking with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damion Poitier">Damion Poitier</a> on his role as <a href="/people/Hand/">Nasara</a> in Crime Boss.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Jingle</a>:</span><span class=sub><i><a href="/culture/K-RCT-Rockay-City-Talk-Radio/" class=soft>K-RCT Rockay City Talk Radio</a></i>.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>So, uh, Damion, I know you also helped with the writing on—on Crime Boss, and so, uh, when we first got approached by the game, before it was even called “Crime Boss,” I think, um, and, you started thinking about the story and the characters, was there, uh, a character in particular that you were excited to flesh out?</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Honestly, like, all of them are very exciting in different ways, some because they’re more challenging and others because they’re, y’know, it’s like, “Oh, we—we haven’t had a chance to play with something like this before.” Y’know, in terms of figuring out who they are, where they come from, [unintelligible] where in Rockay City, all those things, so it—it’s like, y’know from S—<a href="/people/Stinger/">Stinger</a> was a lot of fun, uh, to really kind of put some English behind, y’know, like, OK, why is he like that? What’s his story? How he got there, all of—like I said—all of them, like, I had a lot of fun with <a href="/people/Zulu/">X</a>, like, all of them were very fun to—to look at the world they’re in, figure out where they came from, and how they would get into that world, and why they were there, and what was their motivation for being involved in—in that, specifically, so it’s [unintelligible]. [laughs]</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>Now, you said that some of the characters were really challenging. Which was one of the most challenging characters?</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Some of the like—some of the Eastern European ones, because, y’know, I had to do a lot of research to kind of get into what the backstory would be of how that—they would, first of all, y’know, travel—international travel th—thankfully, Southern Florida was a melting pot of criminality and just, [laughs] like, insane things going on, so it wasn’t too difficult once I kind of put together the person’s circumstance, but, y’know, just—just finding out more about them, where they would be, like, how in—truly insane the ’90s were, and the ’80s leading up to the ’90s to build the character into that space.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>Now, so, the game is set in the ’90s. Was it fun to kind of mentally go back to the ’90s?</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Absolutely.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>…like, I don’t know what the ’90s were like for you, so [chuckles], uh, y’know, y’know, that little bit of time travel—you’re like, “oh, yes, the ’90s.” Like, was there an element of that era you were excited to bring in?</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Oh, absolutely, just, y’know, it’s—yeah, the ’90s were wild. We—we—we kind of we—we’re—we’re—we’re so, like, far but not far from it now that it’s funny to look at it. It was kind of right before the age of, y’know, people really saying, “Hey, you know what, uh, certain things aren’t okay to say—”</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>—this, so, you know, you end up, y’know, you’re in the game. You’re <a href="/people/Hand/" class=soft>Nasara</a>. you’re writing on the game. Is there—uh, is there difficulty in writing, uh, at all for your own character, or is there fun? and is there anything you—like, you slipped in for your character, like, “Yeah, I really wanna say that”?</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>It was—it was really actually a lot of fun, because, y’know, I—I would—I had the—being there for the inception of the character and the total build, I had a lot—they were—my input was greatly appreciated, and I got to do a lot of things that, like, I wanted to do with the character, so there was—I’m not—I don’t want to spoil, so I’m not sure what’s been in yet—what hasn’t—how his backstory evolved and things like that. There—there are a lot of things that were just really fun and really informed: how—why he speaks like that, why he dresses like that, y’know. All—all—everything that <a href="/people/Hand/" class=soft>Nasara</a> does comes from—there’s a—there’s a space for all of him, there’s a placement, and it’s, like, how do I wanna be, and how do I get there, so I got to do the whole roundabout, uh, “this is what I want. How do you get there organically? How does it make sense to have a character be in that space?” and so it was—yeah. I—I know I’m talking, like, very broadly but, like, it’s—I’m trying not to spoil anything—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>That’s all right, that’s all right</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>…yeah, yeah.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>I mean, we do have one thing that we know. If anyone’s looked at the—the <a href="https://visitrockaycity.com/#roadmap">Rockay’s Roadmap</a>, one of the DLCs that are coming in the future is called, uh, Nasara’s Revenge, so we do know—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Yep.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>…that there’s gonna be something interesting with <a href="/people/Hand/" class=soft>Nasara</a> in the future, so—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Yep [laughs].</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>…y’know, very interesting to see how his story does progress, uh, especially within that, uh, paid DLC that’s coming. It—it’ll be—it’ll be next year at some point but, so there’s—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Right.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>…definitely a lot to <a href="/people/Hand/" class=soft>Nasara</a> that we don’t know about yet.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>I’m—I’m gonna ask a Crime Boss question of Fran.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>Oh!</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Oooh.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>But it’s not about me!</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>So—so, you’ve been community manager on the game since—since it launched and I think since its inception. What is one of the most sort of, like, fun things that’s happened since you’ve been on the project?</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>Fun thing that’s happened? Um, I think, actually, uh, when we announced it at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The Game Awards">The Game Awards</a>, I think, was probably an amazing thing. It was als—it was very fun—uh, where I met Damion for the first time in real life. Uh, [laughs] um, it was just a really great, uh, time, it was great, uh, seeing everyone’s reaction to the announce trailer. Uh, it was just a—amazing atmosphere. I would say that it was an amazing time. That’s all I can really say, y’know.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>The—The Game Awards are always fun to watch, and so to be involved in something that’s happening on it and then to be there—so, now, I’ve never actually been to The Game Awards, so, I’ve—I’ve had projects announced on The Game Awards, and that’s cool, and you sit at home, and you press the button to launch your social media, but being there has got to be something else.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>Yeah, yeah, it was really great.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>So, so, Dam—So, you were at The Game Awards, Damion?</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Yessir.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>And—and how was that experience for you? ’Cause I—you’re probably not as much a video game fan as a comic book fan, so The Game Awards is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San Diego Comic-Con">Comic-Con</a> for video games at this point.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Well, yeah—I was—I was at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3">E3</a> every year, y’know. I—I’m—I’m in it man, I’m, y’know, a gamer. I’m not new to the game world, so—been around—I’ve been around. It wa—it was cool to see, y’know, people w–that you wouldn’t expect to run into, like, uh, y’know, uh, we didn’t—E3 didn’t happen this year, but it was—it was like a—a mini behind the scenes E3, y’know, when you see all the different people, it’s, like, “Oh that’s—y’know, from the different companies. And—and—and then the, uh, there was—in the lobby of the hotel there’s, uh, there was a little, like, social gathering afterwards, so you get to run into a lot of people that, y’know, once again it was—you know from different companies and things like that. It’s—it’s a—it’s a good time, it’s really fun to kind of see what everybody’s got coming on and—or what what everybody’s revealing and what—what they’re bringing out, so I—I enjoyed it. I really—I had a good time. It was my first time. It was my first F1 too, I said I’d been to E3, but I’d never been to that, so it was re—really good times to check that out.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>So, back to the writing stuff, because, y’know, I can’t keep my thoughts straight, so I—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>[laughs]</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>…everything goes like—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Stream of consciousness is awesome, just go!</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>Uh, is there—is there any dialogue in the game—and you don’t have to remember the exact quote, but—is there any sort of moment of dialogue that you really, really like? Either an interaction between two characters or—or just a pull quote or—or something like that, that you remember that you’re, like, “Oh, yeah, that was awesome”?</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Yes. [laughs] What I get with all of them!</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>I have a followup question: what was that?</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Well, oh—oh, you’re gonna—this one’s good. Well, here’s the th–like, it’s—’cause when you’re—when you’re doing the—when we’re wh—recording the VO stuff, y’know, like, like, every time we were in there we would have moments with different people. Like, we—we—we had a few like hilarious moments with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny Glover">Danny Glover</a>, obviously there were hilarious moments with—with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael Madsen">Michael Madsen</a>, and, uh, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny Trejo">Mr. Trejo</a>, and, like, s—when you start speaking of specifics, like, my brain immediately, like, scatters and scrambles, ’cause there’s like—there’s so many funny things and, like, okay was that specific—did that actually go into the game, or was that just something, you know? So it was—but they were, like, eve—everybody was a delight to work with some—some of the actor—some of the best lines are actually ad libs just from what we were, y’know, from—we–we’re going in, and we’re talking and different things, and then somebody throws it off off the cuff. It’s kinda like “[unintelligible].” It’s like, “No, no, no, no! Use that!,” and we’re gonna—we’re definitely—like, “It’s goin’ in the game!” and things like that, so it’s so much fun, like, to—to create the framework and then see the discoveries, y’know, ’cause you’re writing thousands and thousands of lines—literally—and—and it—it’s easy to get kind of bogged down into the, y’know, “How many different ways can I say, ‘Get down on the ground?,’” y’know, so it’s [unintelligible] when somebody’s—when you’re in the session, and somebody hits something that’s, like, just, like, a little [smacks lips], you’re, like, “OH, WOW!” Let’s see, I’m trying to come up with something specific….</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>I was saying, I’m sure you’ve said so much. You ain’t gonna remember much—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Yeah, it’s work, yeah.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>…I—there’s one line that I do remember. It’s kind of from the start, which is why I remember it the most, and it was, uh—it’s <a href="/people/Travis-Baker/">Baker</a>, or Michael Madsen. He’s talking about, uh, the—the candy that’s been stolen and—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>I….</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>Uh, your character, <a href="/people/Hand/" class=soft>Nasara</a>, basically says, um, the blue—basically, you go, “Are they blue because they’re downers?” And Madsen–<a href="/people/Travis-Baker/" class=soft>Baker</a> goes, “No because they’re effing blue!” and he goes—and you go, “Oh, branding,” and I just—it just tickles me, because you say it so deadpan, [laughs] and it’s just, and I’m just, like, just, it’s funny, because it’s just so dry. [laughs]</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>That’s, uh—that’s one of the best—the, uh—the—one of the most fun things about <a href="/people/Hand/" class=soft>Nasara</a> is I usually play like fairly, y’know, I—I have a big personality, so I usually play characters with a lot of personality, so to have him just kind of be this level, like, y’know, voice of reason all the way through has been—it’s been so much fun that—that—to—to be in that space and find the the measured response to all of the insanity [laughs]—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>Yeah.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>…that goes on [laughs]—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>…’cause you are. You’re just always the voice of calm with the craziness around.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>So the cast of Crime Boss is remarkable, and so, you had the opportunity to, like, be in there where, like, when everybody comes in to do their their voiceover—uh, was it a little hard not to geek out to a certain extent?</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>I—I—I—I have an inside voice that will scream and run back and forth in my head [laughs] just, y’know, do all this stuff and you—meanwhile, I’m like, “Hey, how you doin’? Nice to meet you. Very much looking forward to working with you,” [laughs] and the geek in me is, like, “OH MY GAWD.” [laughs] So I’m over—over the years of, y’know, being on sets and things like that I’ve for the most part mastered it where I can—I can have like I said my internal voice is—is running around like a chicken with its head cut off screaming at the top of its lungs. It’s super excited, and externally, I’m, like, “Hey, how you doin’?” Like, you—it’s to the point where you almost, like, “Does this guy know what I’ve worked on?” Y’know, I—I’ve kind of gotten that way where I can really just kind of—because I’m—I’ve found that even—even when people are, uh, excited to see me about things <i>I’ve</i> done, when you treat people like people, [laughs] they have—it’s—it’s easier to get, uh, a positive interaction going, y’know, so I always try to make sure I treat—regardless of who I’m working with or whatever—I—I come at them from a very regular, normal, “Hey, how you doin’?” Y’know, “This is what we’re doing” or “This is what we have in common” space and kind of find a grounded space to start the interaction, and then if you say something crazy later, y’know, it’s OK, because they know at least that you’re grounded.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>I have to say by the way in the chat uh Jorge Herenandez says that he’s been playing the game with his wife, and she loves your voice in the game.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Well, thank you. Appreciated.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>I mean—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Wh—wh—It was an—it was an evolution to find <a href="/people/Hand/" class=soft>Nasara</a>’s voice, too. That was a lot of fun of exactly—y’know, where we wanted it to end up—where we wanted—how we wanted him to sound, and, y’know, the words he chooses—it was all—it was all very, very, very fun evolution through development.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>I’ll tell you what we could do, Damion. Would you be up for some ASMR with—with <a href="/people/Hand/" class=soft>Nasara</a>? I reckon that could go down really well. [laughs]</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>You—you could do like a bedtime story—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Right? [laughs]</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>…I know my wife likes to listen to those phone app stories where they just, like, kinda talk and you should have <a href="/people/Hand/" class=soft>Nasara</a>, uh—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>We should definitely do <a href="/people/Hand/" class=soft>Nasara</a> one. That would be hilarious to figure that out.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>We should try it now and see if it works. Um, what should we have you say, uh, um—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>Well, uh, it has to be Nasara tucking you in at night, telling you to, like, lay down, relax, and—and fall asleep.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>Um—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Like, “The day is coming to a close.” [laughs] “It’s time to listen—” I w—I would—I would need some time, ’cause he’s—he’s so—he speaks so specifically. I need—y’know, I have to warm up into his voice. You know what I mean, ’cause it’s, uh—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>You—you could try talking about the temperature of the room—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Right? You know—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>Um, it’s eight-oh-six o’clock at night—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Right, yeah.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>…it’s the perfect time to sleep.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Well, no. He would go military time. He would probably put—say, uh “sixteen”—“sixteen” [giggles]</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>OK, we can work on this.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Yeah, we de—we definitely—so this is something that—let me—either right after a voice session—[laughs] or we sit down and work on it and work up to it, because, dude, that’s—like I said, he’s so specific that it’s, uh—</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>Yeah, OK.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>We—we can have a whole side project of just, uh, Crime Boss Bedtime Stories, and I’m all in for it.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>We will make this happen.
