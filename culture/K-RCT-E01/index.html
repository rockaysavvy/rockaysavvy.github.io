Today we’re speaking with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damion Poitier">Damion Poitier</a> on his role as <a href="/people/Hand/">Nasara</a> in Crime Boss.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>Hello, Damion, thanks for joining us today. Let’s dive right into the questions. What makes Crime Boss: Rockay City different from other crime- and heist first-person shooter games? What are the unique selling points?</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>There are many aspects that are very—that are high selling points. Uh, one is the metagame, which is the way you manage your—your funds and your team and basically your heists and what your—aspects you’re going to invest in in the game, and that allows a great deal of scalability in terms of what your gameplay will look like.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>There’s the individual characters: all the different personalities that you’re gonna encounter in Rockay City that you can interact with the—what they bring to the table: their stories, their backstories, their missions, their goals, so it’s a huge conglomeration of so many different events, some working with you, some that are working against you, that are really—create this—this incredible amalgamation of so many different aspects that we had before, but not in the same package.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>What can you tell us about the game’s story and how your character comes into play?</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>So the story of the game is the—the city of Rockay, y’know, has been under certain care—under the care of a certain steward for some time, and now that steward passes, and that creates a huge power vacuum in the city, now all the different <a href="/people/gang-bosses/">criminal aspects</a> of the city are coming together and against each other and trying to figure out who is going to be the next King of Rockay City: who’s gonna be the crime boss now that the <a href="/people/King/">old one</a> has fallen.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>So, my character <a href="/people/Hand/" class=soft>Nasara</a> comes in as the right hand of <a href="/people/Travis-Baker/">Travis Baker</a>, which is the entry character. He’s the initial crime boss character that you’re bringing into precedent, and what <a href="/people/Hand/" class=soft>Nasara</a>’s doing is he’s bringing his knowledge of the city—his knowledge of different personalities in the city and aspects of the city to <a href="/people/Travis-Baker/" class=soft>Travis</a>’s toolbox as he goes through his ascension.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>How different is acting for video games compared to acting for films?</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>When you compare the differences in, like, doing a film production versus doing a video game production, they’re—they’re, like, wildly different and strangely similar in that, y’know, you’re still performing, you still have to understand who and where the character comes from and what brings them to the point that you’re in, but when you’re doing just voice—because a lot of times when you’re doing a video game you—you’re doing—performing the character potentially three times: one time for the voice capture, one time for the facial capture, and another time for the motion capture, so there’s three different opportunities, and sometimes those are split by—between different actors as well.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>I like as much as possible to perform all three and I’ve been very fortunate in my later endeavors that i’ve [unintelligible] had that opportunity, but the voice aspect is one thing: you’re totally telling the story with your voice, so you have to make sure that all your emotion and all the things that you need to bring are brought through to convey whatever aspect of the story you’re bringing to life at that point.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>when you’re doing facial capture, it’s another thing, because you want to make sure you’re matching the tonality of—of what you what you brought emotionally, so the expressions are very important in how you move and what you do with them, and when you’re on a camera—video game, y’know, sometimes it’s a wide shot; sometimes it’s a closeup. It can go either way within the same scene, so you have to perform in a—in a kind of a broad way that enables for any of those to work as best you can.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>And then with motion capture, you’re putting on the suit, you’re going through the motions, you’re using the different props, and you’re bringing—you’re bringing it all together, y’know. That’s when you’re—that’s the the physical expression of things. Most times you’re not recording voice for the game at the same time as you’re doing motion capture, so it gives you another opportunity to express the character in a different way.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>Now, you’ve done some writing for Crime Boss. Were there any challenges with its deep storytelling, considering you may never have the same playthrough twice in the game?</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>Writing Crime Boss was as rewarding as it was challenging, because with so many different characters and so many different moving parts, seeing as how the gameplay will virtually never be the same twice, you have to make sure that there’s enough background and story and pieces that you can put into place—make it all come together—and having the organic backstory and nature of the character actually makes it easier, because you know what will bring certain aspects of it together—and making sure that you have a tight through line of okay, where is this person, what is this person doing, what are their goals, how did they get here?—you know, all of those different aspects come into play and make the amalgamation that is the game that you get wonderfully different each time, because, y’know, with them all having their own goals, sometimes they’ll interact with each other, they’ll interact with the other opponents that are trying to get involved, and that’ll all affect what they do and how they end up interacting with you and the different situations that you’re placed within.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>What do you think players will be most excited about?</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Damion Poitier</a>:</span><span class=sub>When I look at this game, I think the replayability is—is one of my favorite aspects of it, because it’s so—you can get such vastly different games, y’know, every time you play, so the—the fact that the discovery of all the different personalities and what they have going on—there’s so many aspects of this game that are—that are incredibly exciting for anyone who’s involved in playing it, because the different characters, the personalities, the different missions, the way you approach the missions can be different every single time, you know. Who you have involved on your team can affect how you’re able to get introduced to a mission, you know, the—the aspect of who you don’t have on your team: maybe you had someone on your team one point, and maybe either they died, or you just weren’t able to get them, or something else happened, and how that affects—just, all the permutations, just being able to—to get into this living, breathing world that is Rockay and—and—and experience it different every time is—whew, I can’t wait!</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>That’s great. Hey, thanks for joining us today.

And now, let’s look to the highways with our eye in the sky, <a href="/people/Annie-the-Granny/" class=soft>Annie the Granny</a>.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Annie-the-Granny/>Annie the Granny</a>:</span><span class=sub>Hello Bickley, did you enjoy the mulberry pie I dropped by the station? In <span>Downtown</span> Rockay City there’s multiple road closures due to turf war going on. Looks like it’s between the <a href="/people/Dollar-Dragon/">Dragon</a> and that new guy, y’know, <a href="/people/Travis-Baker/" class=soft>the one with the fancy hat</a>? Anyway, expect heavy traffic and delays in the area. The closures include: entrance to <span>City Beach</span>, <span>Grove</span>, and <span>Midtown</span>. Please allow extra time or plan an alternate route.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>Thanks again Annie, not just for the pies but for your eyes in the sky above Rockay City, keeping those streets clear.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Bickley St. James</a>:</span><span class=sub>And now we have a full hour of ad-free talk radio, brought to you by our friends at <a href="/culture/Skeety-Kitty-Arms/" class=soft>Skeety Kitty Arms</a>: weapons for the whole family. Through Sunday, buy three cases of ammo at regular price, get a free year-long child’s membership to the shooting range for free.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Jingle</a>:</span><span class=sub><i><a href="/culture/K-RCT-Rockay-City-Talk-Radio/" class=soft>K-RCT Rockay City Talk Radio</a></i>.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/>Fran Ann McGann</a>:</span><span class=sub>This is <a href="/people/Fran-Ann-McGann/">Fran Ann McGann</a> reporting from Rockay City. Even if you didn’t see <a href="/culture/party-explosion/">the explosion</a>, you definitely heard it. The top floors of the skyscraper are raining down with debris across the whole of Rockay City. It took out <a href="/people/King/" class=soft>the King of Crime</a>. The destruction, the damage to public property will no doubt run into gazillions. But there’s greater damage to the city than the fiery debris that rained down onto flashy cars, high-cost bars, and people wielding cigars. In one fell blow, <a href="/people/King/" class=soft>the King of Crime</a> is gone, leaving a power vacuum. Rival gangs seem to be carving up territory, and the cops are out for revenge. The violence on the street is increasing, both for those upholding the law and those breaking it. That’s not the only problem: a new drug, blue in color and going by the street name “candy” has hit the streets. The gangs aren’t just supplying it, they’re fighting each other over the supply. I heard that one shipment was stolen and stolen back all in the course of one day.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Jingle</a>:</span><span class=sub><i><a href="/culture/K-RCT-Rockay-City-Talk-Radio/" class=soft>K-RCT Rockay City Talk Radio</a></i>.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Advertisement</a>:</span><span class=sub>Get the latest copy of RockON Magazine right now: your source for all of the news, views, and truths about Rockay City.
