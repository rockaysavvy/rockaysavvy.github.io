First off, there was sand <i>everywhere</i>. I mean, it’s a beach, so I suppose that’s to be expected, but this was a real excessive amount of sand. I was practically wading through it just to get to the shoreline.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Karl-McGnarl/>Karl McGnarl</a>:</span><span class=sub>And speaking of the shoreline, there were crabs everywhere, big ones, little ones, all scurrying around like they own the joint. I don’t know about you, but I’m not a big fan of crabs. They’ve got these beady little eyes and those creepy claws. It’s not my idea of a good time.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Karl-McGnarl/>Karl McGnarl</a>:</span><span class=sub>But the real kicker was all the rubbish. I mean, come on, people, have a bit of respect for the environment! There were soda cans and plastic bags strewn about like nobody’s business. It was like a garbage dump had exploded and landed right on the beach.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Karl-McGnarl/>Karl McGnarl</a>:</span><span class=sub>Overall I’ve got to say this beach was a bit of a letdown. I wasn’t expecting pristine white sand and crystal-clear waters but this was something else entirely. The sand was overwhelming, the crabs were unsettling, and the rubbish was just plain disappointing. I wasn’t—it was mostly all bicycles.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Karl-McGnarl/>Karl McGnarl</a>:</span><span class=sub>I used to have a BMX when I was a kid. I hit a rock and flew over the handlebar—smashed into a tree. The weird thing was that when I hit the tree, a cat fell out and landed on my head. Apparently that cat had been lost for two weeks, stuck up the tree. </span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Karl-McGnarl/>Karl McGnarl</a>:</span><span class=sub>Would I go back? Probably not. But hey, at least I’ve seen it all now. No cats there, though.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Karl-McGnarl/>Karl McGnarl</a>:</span><span class=sub>All right, then. So I was walking around this <span>Downtown</span> the other day. They were a bit mental. Everywhere you look there’s skyscrapers reaching up to the sky like giant metal fingers. And don’t even get me started on the neon signs. I mean, who needs that many bright colors all in one place?</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Karl-McGnarl/>Karl McGnarl</a>:</span><span class=sub>What really threw me off were the people in the street. They were just running around like maniacs holding <span>bricks</span> and smashing things left and right. I’m not sure what the problem was, but I didn’t want to stick around to find out. It was like a scene from a post-apocalyptic movie or something. I half-expected to see zombies stumbling out of the allies, but nope—just regular people going about their day, throwing <span>bricks</span> and causing chaos.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Karl-McGnarl/>Karl McGnarl</a>:</span><span class=sub>I’ve gotta say I wasn’t a f—uh, a fan of this part of the scene. Too many tall buildings, too much noise, and way too many brick-wielding lunatics. I wouldn’t recommend it as a holiday destination, that’s for sure. Unless you’re into that sort of thing, I suppose, but me? I’ll stick to the countryside, where the most exciting thing you’ll see is a cow wandering around.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Karl-McGnarl/>Karl McGnarl</a>:</span><span class=sub>I went to <span>Rockay Port</span> the other day, and, honestly, it was a bit of a strange place. There were boats as far as the eye could see, and they were all massive. I’m talking, like, bigger than your average house, and the noise they made? My ears are still ringing.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Karl-McGnarl/>Karl McGnarl</a>:</span><span class=sub>It wasn’t just the boats that were weird. The whole place was surrounded by these giant crates and shipping containers full of who knows what? I mean, I saw one container with “FRAGILE” written on it in big letters, but I’m pretty sure the people handling it weren’t treating it with the care it deserved.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Karl-McGnarl/>Karl McGnarl</a>:</span><span class=sub>And the smell? Ugh, man, I don’t even know how to describe it. It was like a mixture of fish and diesel fuel and God knows what else? Definitely not a fragrance I’d want to bottle up and wear as a cologne.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Karl-McGnarl/>Karl McGnarl</a>:</span><span class=sub>But you know what the strangest thing was? I didn’t even see a single person around. Just boats and crates and containers. It was like a ghost town but with ships instead of buildings and seagulls instead of people. And a seagull actually ate my fish and chips once. They ate the whole thing! Swooped in and took it all.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a href=/people/Karl-McGnarl/>Karl McGnarl</a>:</span><span class=sub>Overall, I’ve got to say this <span>port</span> was not my cup of tea. It’s too loud, too smelly, and too many mysterious crates. I wouldn’t recommend it as a vacation spot unless you’re really into boats and weird smells.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Musical interlude</a>:</span><span class=sub><i>Crime Boss: Rockay City trailer theme.</i></span></p><div class=interlude><blockquote><p>[3x]<br>Gonna rule them all<br>I will break these walls<br>Waited for too long<br>Known it all along<p>Rule them all<br>Break these walls<br>For too long<br>Known it all<br>And I did the crime!</blockquote></div><p ><span class=speaker><a >Jingle</a>:</span><span class=sub><i><a href="/culture/K-RCT-Rockay-City-Talk-Radio/" class=soft>K-RCT Rockay City Talk Radio</a></i>.</span></p><p ><span class=speaker><a >Advertisement</a>:</span><span class=sub>Hey, come on over to the Laffa Motel.
